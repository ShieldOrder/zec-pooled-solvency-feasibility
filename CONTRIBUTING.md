Status: feasibility analysis artifact  
Posture: descriptive, adversarial to assumptions, non-prescriptive  
Scope: cryptographic and verification feasibility under explicit constraints

This repository exists to test whether specific cryptographic and verification claims can be made rigorous.

It does not assume that a viable system exists.
It does not assume that a viable system should exist.

Failure, impossibility, or abandonment are valid and informative outcomes.

## Contribution Posture

Contributions are welcome when they improve:

- rigor
- falsifiability
- clarity of assumptions
- explicitness of constraints
- explicitness of failure conditions

Contributions should treat feasibility as an open question, not a goal.

## In Scope

Contributions may include:

- Cryptographic soundness analysis
- Proof sketch critique or gap identification
- Threat model expansion or adversary refinement
- Deterministic verification analysis
- Canonical serialization review
- Negative or adversarial test vector design
- Reorg, finality, and chain state analysis
- Explicit impossibility or infeasibility arguments

All claims should be supported by artifacts, not intent.

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope:

- Product framing or roadmap discussion
- UX, wallet, or integration considerations
- Yield, incentive, or economic modeling
- Governance, policy, or regulatory advocacy
- Assumptions of deployment or adoption
- Scope expansion beyond stated feasibility constraints

## Contribution Discipline

When contributing:

- State assumptions explicitly
- Name trust boundaries
- Identify failure modes
- Prefer disproof to optimism
- Treat missing artifacts as blocking defects
- Avoid narrative justification in place of evidence

A contribution that weakens feasibility is still a successful contribution.

## Disagreement

Disagreement is expected.

Disputes should be expressed through:

- counterexamples
- alternative constructions
- revised threat models
- tighter constraints

This repository does not arbitrate conclusions.
