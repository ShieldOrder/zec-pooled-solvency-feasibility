Status: feasibility analysis artifact  
Posture: adversarial to assumptions, non-prescriptive  
Scope: cryptographic and verification feasibility

This repository examines whether specific cryptographic constructions and verification claims are feasible under stated constraints.

It is not a product effort.
It is not a deployment plan.
It does not assume feasibility.

Failure, impossibility, or abandonment are valid outcomes.

## What Contributions Are For

Contributions should:
- increase rigor
- reduce ambiguity
- surface hidden assumptions
- tighten threat models
- identify explicit failure conditions
- provide counterexamples or impossibility arguments

Weakening feasibility is a successful contribution.

## In Scope

- Cryptographic soundness analysis
- Proof sketch critique or gap identification
- Primitive availability analysis
- Threat model critique or expansion
- Deterministic verification analysis
- Canonical serialization review
- Adversarial or negative test vectors
- Reorg, finality, and chain-state analysis
- Explicit infeasibility arguments

All claims must be grounded in artifacts.

## Out of Scope

- Product framing or roadmap discussion
- Wallet or UX considerations
- Integration planning
- Economic or incentive modeling
- Governance or policy advocacy
- Assumptions of adoption or deployment

## Contribution Discipline

When contributing:
- state assumptions explicitly
- name trust boundaries
- identify failure modes
- prefer counterexamples over optimism
- treat missing artifacts as blocking defects
- avoid narrative justification in place of evidence

## Disagreement

Disagreement is expected.

Disputes should be expressed through:
- counterexamples
- alternative constructions
- revised threat models
- tighter or conflicting constraints

This repository does not arbitrate conclusions.
