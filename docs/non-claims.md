# Non-Claims Guardrail

Status: guardrail
Posture: descriptive, non-prescriptive
Scope: prevent ungrounded claims and reputation leakage in this repository

This repository is a feasibility artifact. It prioritizes falsifiability and clean separation between what is known, what is assumed, and what is unresolved.

This file exists to prevent contamination from ungrounded external summaries, speculative reviews, or implied endorsements.

## This repository does not claim

- Any endorsement, review, approval, or participation by named individuals or organizations unless it is explicitly documented in-repo with a linkable artifact.
- That protocol primitives exist or do not exist unless an explicit argument is provided in-repo.
- That a construction is possible, secure, or private unless supported by explicit statements, constraints, and verifiable artifacts.
- That a construction is impossible unless supported by a clear, reproducible infeasibility argument.
- That any external tool has "fetched", "searched", or "reviewed" this repository unless the produced output includes direct citations to the exact files and passages used.

## Allowed language (preferred)

- "Unknown under current assumptions."
- "Not demonstrated in this repository."
- "Requires Gate 0 (primitive discovery)."
- "Would require additional trust assumptions."
- "Potential mismatch; needs explicit statement-of-claims and verification model."

## Disallowed language (unless proven in-repo)

- "Reviewed by X", "approved by X", "panel verdict", or similar.
- "Solved", "guaranteed", "trustless" (unless a concrete model is defined).
- "Terminal impossibility" (unless accompanied by a clear infeasibility argument).

## Contribution discipline

If you add critique summaries, ensure they are:

- anchored to specific repository files
- phrased as questions or hypotheses, not verdicts
- explicit about what is assumed vs. what is demonstrated
